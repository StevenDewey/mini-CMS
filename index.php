	<h2>Here's what Digital Humanities means to me:</h2>
	<blockquote>
		Did the images above match your initial reaction to what "Digital Humanities" could be? No, Digital Humanities is not building robots to reenact classic paintings... Digital Humanities is the combination of technology and the humanities. My first reaction to the combination of this seemingly contradicting statement, was blogging. Mainly because I think of blogging as a form of expression, just as the humanities are. And this probably goes without saying, but blogging is definitely digital. Turns out Digital Humanities is a bit more than just blogging. The digital world offers interesting opportunities for the expression of humanities. From curating online collections to data mining large cultural data sets to virtual tours of historic sites, digital humanities is a new and interesting concept.  Many universities are now supporting the new field and offering undergraduate and graduate programs in the field. However, in my research I found opposing viewpoints on the growth and sustainability of the new field.
